---

Mainnet is the main blockchain where Decred has real-world economic value.

It is not recommended to test new or experimental features on mainnet.
Testing on [testnet](testnet.md) or [simnet](simnet.md) is more appropriate.
These networks carry no economic value, so testing can be performed free from risk or cost.
